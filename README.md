# mapcss README

This is a simple language extension to support `mapcss` file editing in VS Code.

As `mapcss` is a CSS-like language, it uses the standard CSS configuration as a jumping-off point and makes modifications from there.

See the [OpenStreetMap Wiki page dedicated to MapCSS]([https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapCSS/0.2) for detailed explanations of the various properties and concepts which differ from standard CSS.
